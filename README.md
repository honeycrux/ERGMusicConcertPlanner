The ERGMusic Concert Planner is an application written to simplify work in event organization of the ERGMusic concert.

This project is still maintained by its author, which means fixes and additions may be done if time allows. You may post issues and suggestions to Issues.

**In its current state, without an authentication layer and page access control, this application allows all modification of data unrestricted. Therefore, it should not be hosted on the Internet, and should only be used locally with shared credentials among trusted members.**

## Vision and Expectation
This application is written for current and potentially future rundown organizers of ERGMusic.

For this project to be usable by future users, it should contain clear and complete instructions for users who wants to set this project up on their own and might be unfamiliar with the technology.

For this project to be modifiable by future developers, it should be open-sourced and depend mostly on commonly-used tools within the web development community, so that the learning barrier is minimal. All documentations that exist for this project will be accessible from this project.

As a semester-time project, the project requires minimal development time. Features and interfaces are expected to be barebone.
